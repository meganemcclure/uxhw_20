                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        In today's digital age, the market for social apps is oversaturated with an abundance 
                        of platforms that encourage hookup culture and shallow connections. Unfortunately, this 
                        emphasis can impede individuals from finding authentic friendships within their 
                        respective communities, leaving them feeling disconnected and unfulfilled.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Millennials, who spearheaded the social media era, are increasingly reliant on online 
                        sources to meet and connect. However, this shift has also led to a rise in social anxiety 
                        and isolation, making it challenging for them to form meaningful friendships and a sense 
                        of community – especially when online engagement is often superficial.

                <p>
                    Our team executed a series of 5 interviews with individuals from the target 
                    demographic (i.e. millennials ages 27-42). Additionally we conducted a survey 
                    and used secondary data (i.e. via online sources) to inform our research and 
                    overall plan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Based on our interviews we identified the following themes and developed a 
                    User Persona to reflect our target user
                </p>

                <div class="secondarySection">

                        <li>
                            Millenials are lonley! “A poll of about 1,200 people by YouGov found 27% of 
                            Millennials have no close friends, and 22% report they have no friends at all. 
                            Most people find it difficult to make friends because they’re shy (53%), but 
                            people also report friendship is too much work (20%) or they are too busy 
                            (14%).” Forbes (2021)”

                        <li>
                            Despite the hurles that make connecting online more difficult, millennials 
                            have a strong desire to engage, but they crave social apps that simplify the 
                            process and eliminate poorly thought-out platforms and illegitimate profiles.

                    <p>The widespread prevalence of online engagement has contributed to the emergence of 
                        limited social interaction models, which produce unsatisfactory outcomes for users. 
                        Millennials specifically encounter challenges in forming genuine connections, leading 
                        to a pervasive sense of loneliness and dissatisfaction.

                <h2>Phase 5: Usability Testing & Iterations</h2>
                <p>
                    Next up we completed 2 rounds user testing an iteration on our lo-fi prototypes. Why 
                    2 rounds? we wanted to ensure the UX was nailed down before creating any Hi-Fi mockups.

                            <b>Problem:</b> The swipe behaviour for the onboarding was not clear to users. Many 
                            wanted to tap on the arrows instead of swipe, and about 50% of the users who picked 
                            up on the swipe behaviour thought the arrow was telling them to swipe in the opposite 
                            direction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Solution:</b> Update swipe to tap.

                            was not clear to users. They often didn't know if the buddies, groups, and events 
                            they were seeing were new (recommended) or ones they had already connected with.

                            made it feel like a hookup application (oops, not our intention, platonic friends

                    <p>
                        <b>Problem:</b> Users pointed out that the transition between the onboarding 
                        and app exploration was jarring, and could use some sort of transition screen 
                        to give users some sort of direction on where to go.

                    <p>
                        <b>Why:</b> users still found concepts like the difference between 'adding' and 'saving' a buddy or concepts like

                        <b>Why:</b> issue brought up by users in our initial interviews, that we did not focus on during the project. It is 
                        important nonetheless.

                        <b>Planned Improvement:</b> Not all default profile fields are included in the onboarding
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Why:</b> never defined all the default profile information, so for many users signing up, some parts of their 
                        profile would not be filled in from onboarding
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Why:</b> this was an idea we were excited about implementing, but due to time constraints we did not get around 
                        to actually prototyping it
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        <b>Planned Improvement:</b> re-write copy for email newsletter subscriptions
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Why:</b> users were still unclear about what they were signing up for in the newsletter section
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <b>Planned Improvement:</b> make add, save, and remove buttons more prominent
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Why:</b> many users still missed these in our second round of usability testing, and they are a main focus of 
                        the application, so we want people to see them

                    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>So, what did we actually learn from this project?</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>There is a need - millennials WANT to engage, but the existing social apps are limiting.</li>
                        <li>it's important to consider the nuances that differentiate dating apps and friendship apps, as the expectations can be very different. Therefore BuddySystem should carefully consider and reflect on those differences in design.</li>
                        <li>Branding and marketing is essential in communicating the purpose of BuddySystem. Branding is an essential tool in mitigating users signing up for the wrong reasons.</li>
                        <li>Onboarding is an important tool for emphasizing the purpose and ultimately controlling the users' experience by incorporating capability features that speak to their needs, namely friendship and community building.</li>
